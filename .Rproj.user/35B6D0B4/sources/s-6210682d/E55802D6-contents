### Question 1:

##### (a) (1 pt) Assume diastolic blood pressure is normally distributed in a certain population, with a mean of 82 mmHg and a standard deviation 11 mmHg. What proportion of this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg (i.e., what is the probability that a person in this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60)?

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
pnorm(60,82,11)
```

*About 2.275% of the population have a diastolic blood pressure less than 60mmHg.*

##### (b) (1 pt) What diastolic blood pressure would put an individual from this population at the 98th percentile?

```{R}
qnorm(.98,82,11)
```

*your answer here, 1-2 sentences*

##### (c) (1 pt) What is the probability that a random individual from this population will have a diastolic blood pressure higher than 100? (Equivalently, what proportion of the population has a diastolic BP greater than 100 mmHg?)

```{R}
1-pnorm(100,82,11)
```

*About 5% of the population has a diastolic blood pressure greater than 100mmHg*


##### (d) (1 pt) What proportion of the population has a diastolic blood pressure bewteen 80 and 90?

```{R}
pnorm(90,82,11)-pnorm(80,82,11)
```

*About 33% of the population has a diastolic blood pressure greater between 80mmHg and 90mmHg.*

##### (e) (1 pt) Assume this is the distribution of diastolic blood pressure for a healthy population. If we observe an individual from an unknown population with a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg, what is the probability of observing an individual with a BP this extreme (i.e., in *either direction of the mean*) if the individual really came from a normal population with a mean of 82 and standard deviation of 11?

```{R}
(1-pnorm(110,82,11))*2
```

*There is about a 1% probability of having a diastilic blood pressure as extreme as 110mmHg (in either direction of the mean)*


### Question 2

Now, set the seed to 348 with `set.seed()`. Then, with `rnorm` take a sample of size 10,000 from a normal distribution with a mean of 82 and a standard deviation of 11.

##### (a) (3 pts) Using sum() on a logical vector, how many draws are less than 60? Using mean() on a logical vector, what proportion of the total draws is that? How far is your answer from pnorm() in 1.1 above?


```{R}
set.seed(348)
df1<-data.frame(norms=rnorm(10000,82,11))
sum(df1<60)
mean(df1<60)
```

*215 draws have values less than 60, which was about 2.15%. This is 0.13% less than 1.1*

##### (b) (2 pts) What proportion of your sample is greater than 110 or less than 54?

```{R}
sum(df1>110,df1<54)
mean(df1>110)+mean(df1<54)
```

*The sample proportion greater than 110 or less 54 is about 1.05%*

##### (c) (2 pts) Why are your answers close to what you got above? Why are they not exactly the same?

*The answers are similar because the pnorm function calculates the population percentage within a normal distribution.*
---

##### (d) (3 pts) Using ggplot2, make a histogram of your sample. Set y=..density.. inside aes(). Overlay a normal distribution with +stat_function(aes(samp), fun=dnorm, args=list(82,11)). Using geom_vline(xintercept=), add dashed vertical lines corresponding to the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile of the sample

```{R}
ggplot(df1)+geom_histogram(aes(norms,..density..))+
  stat_function(aes(norms),fun=dnorm,args=list(82,11))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(norms,0.025))
```

### Question 3

##### (a) (2 pt) Using `dplyr` functions (filter, summarize; do not use any [] or $) and the `faithful` dataset, what is the standard deviation of `eruptions` when `waiting` is less than the median? 

```{R}

faithful%>%filter(waiting<median(waiting))%>%summarize(sd(eruptions))
```

##### (b) (3 pt) Using `dplyr` and the `faithful` dataset, create new variables that give `eruption` and `waiting` time in *hours* rather than *minutes*. Use `mutate()` *only once* to achieve this! Do not use any [] or $.

```{R}
faithful%>%mutate(eruptionshr=eruptions/60,waitinghr=waiting/60)
```
